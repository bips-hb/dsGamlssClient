Description: DataSHIELD client-side functions to fit Generalized Additive
    Models for Location, Scale and Shape using DataSHIELD.  DataSHIELD is
    a software infrastructure which allows you to do non-disclosive
    federated analysis on sensitive data. Note that DataSHIELD has a
    client-server infrastructure, so the dsGamlss package needs to be used
    in conjunction with the dsGamlssClient package.
